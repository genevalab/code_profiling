# code_profiling
C4L class activity for profiling code

Today, we'll walk through exercises to perform code profiling in Python and R using a set of examples I've modified from a [workshop presented by Princeton Research Computing](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/intro_debugging).

Before class, you should have installed the following programs on your computer:

1. R and RStudio (instructions for both on [this page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))
2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install)
3. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/data-science/?var=anaconda)
